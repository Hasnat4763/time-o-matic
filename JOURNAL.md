# July 8th: Started working!

Started working on my table clock
selected ESP32 WROOM E as my microcontroller

**Total time spent: 1.5h**


# July 10th: tidied up the schematic and selected some parts!

Someone at kicad discord told me to organize my schematic so I did that
added a few switches for navigation
decided to use a cheap tp4056 module for battery charging
selected NEO-M8 GPS module to get time and location data (Maybe use it as a personal time server or gift it to crush to get her house location :)) )

# July 15th: tidying up the PCB!

I think that I don't need my pcb that big and only need 4 switches so I removed two switches
